# Corporate Workshop Materials

This repository includes materials (code, config, etc.) for a variety of corporate workshops taught by [Daniel Whitenack](https://www.datadan.io/). Note, the material has been designed to be taught in a classroom environment. The code is well commented but missing some of the contextual concepts and ideas that will be covered in person.

If you need further help productionizing ML/AI workflows, want to bring these workshops to your company, or just have ML/AI related questions, Daniel is here to help! Reach out via [this email](mailto:dan@datadan.io).
